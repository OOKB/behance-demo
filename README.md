# behance-demo

This is an experiment into using Behance as a basic content management sysytem to power a simple portfolio ... basically templating and styling the JSON output from behance.net using just a simple set of mustache templates.

current live demos:<br>

Outcomes are severely limited due to the constraints of the project:

- low barrier to entry
- all rendering happens in the browser
- very little Javascript knowledge required
- get all data from Behance, little to no project content should live in the HTML

As this project evolves more templates, instructions, outcomes, etc. will be created.
