# behance-demo

This is an experiment into using Behance as a basic content management sysytem to power a simple portfolio ... basically templating and styling the JSON output from behance.net using just a simple set of mustache templates.

current live demos:<br>

Outcomes are severely limited due to the constraints of the tools, and some other overarching ideas:

- low barrier to entry
- very little Javascript knowledge required
- all rendering happens in the browser
- edit/design with simple HTML and CSS
- get all data from Behance, little to no project content should live in the HTML
- what content you can show is limited to what content behance's prebuilt API calls return (can rely on behance API documentation for solving data related problems hopefully)

The main point: simple, semi-custom display for your behance projects. Get a nice, simple portfolio up that you still weild some control over, but have very little to manage and upkeep on your end. Make something that can be freely hosted on gh-pages.

Basically, we're providing you a list of projects and you get to decide how to display that list.

As this project evolves more templates, instructions, outcomes, etc. will be created.
